    "In this pre-class assignment you will work to develop a program to generate a **graph** from a set of points on an XY-plane using the nearest neighbor graphing algorithm. This will set the stage for work that we will do in-class where you will work with your group to solve the problem of assigning cell phone tower frequencies and visualizing them as a graph. You'll being using `networkx` to create a `Graph()` object that you can manipulate to accomplish this task.\n",

    "**Notes about the assignment**: The most important pieces of the second part of this assignment (the graph theory component) are Steps 1 and 2. Step 3 might be a bit challenging because you have to figure out the right syntax to get the NetworkX module to work. Feel free to discuss issues you run into with others on Slack. It's OK if you can't get Part 3 figured out before class as long as you've tried it. Make sure you complete the final part of the assignment where you're asked to come up with an outline for how you would solve the cell phone tower problem."
